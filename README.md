# Digi4-2-book - book download

This project allows you to download books from Digi4School, a website where books are hosted online. It works by downloading all of the SVG files and then converting them to PDF.

## Features

Currently, it's only possible to download one selected book. However, the following features are planned for future implementation:

- Download only a selected page from a book
- Download a range of pages from a book
- Download all books that the user owns

## Installation

The installation process varies depending on your operating system.

### Linux

To run this program on Linux, you need to install some packages. Here's the installation process:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows
For Windows users, you need to install GTK for Windows Runtime Environment Installer from the latest releases. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases). After installing it, you can then run the requirements.txt file as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
